## 什么是CDN？
A CDN is essentially a network of geographically dispersed servers. Each CDN node
caches the static content of a site like the images, CSS/JS file and other structural
components. The majority of an end-user’s page load time is spent on retrieving this content, and so it makes sense to provide these “building blocks” of a site in as many server nodes as possible, distributed throughout the world.

## 为什么用CDN？
The number one reason for using a CDN is to improve your user’s experience in terms of speed, and as we know – speed matters!

CDNs not only ensure a faster experience to your users, but they also help to prevent site crashes in the event of traffic surges – CDNs help to distribute bandwidth across multiple servers, instead of allowing one server to handle all traffic.

## 使用CDN必要吗？
It dependents, will a CDN help improve the performance of your website? Yes. Is it absolutely required for all websites? No. You can still provide a decently fast website experience without a CDN – but it would probably be faster with one.

For those with heavy traffic, mission critical websites and that are serious about providing the best possible experience for all their users, a CDN should be a crucial part of their optimization strategy.

On the other hand, CDN doesn’t work offline, you cannot develop without a net connection.
